# mimic: Implement Microsimulations to Economically Evaluate Mental Health Services

Tools for developing simple microsimulations of mental health services
and exporting outputs for cost-utility analyses. Designed for use with
the ready4 framework (https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/). This early
development version of mimic has been made available as part of the
process of testing and documenting the library. If you have any
questions, please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
